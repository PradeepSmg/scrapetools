In recent years, after Nvidia has revealed stakes in public companies, investors have bought up the stocks, even with tangential connections to AI. Intel's stock rose 18% the day that Nvidia announced its investment. [...] In 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT and made the broader world aware of the importance of Nvidia's graphics processing units. Since then, Nvidia's market cap has grown from just over $420 billion to about $4.3 trillionwhile its annual revenue has increased by 383% from $27 billion in the company's fiscal 2023 to $130.5 billion in the fiscal year ended in January.",
